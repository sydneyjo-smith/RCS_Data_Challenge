# Quarterly Summary

This page provides a high-level summary of the moving average performance indicators for a single trust within a single quarter.

*If an audit does not appear when a trust and quarter are chosen: The trust did not provide any data around that cancer type for that quarter, or the data was not linked to the trust within the audit data. If you believe this to be an error, please reach out to NATCAN or trust administration for more information.*

*If a cell appears blank: The case volume was below the threshold to report the data ethically. In order to protect the safety and anonymity of the patients receiving care, the true value of the cell is not shown on public-facing dashboards.*

#### Dropdown Options

-   **Select Hospital:** Switch between Hospital Trusts

-   **Select Quarter:** Switch between quarter year. By default, the data returned will be the most recent complete quarter. If a quarter is NOT available, the page will return blank.

-   **Select Colour Mode:** Switch between standard (default) and colour vision deficiency mode. This will update the colour gradients used in the table cells.

-   Select Decimal Places: Switch between 0 (default),1,2 decimal places to be displayed in table cells.

#### Description of features

-   **Metric Name:** Defines metric for measurement. For further detail and definitions of metrics, please visit the NATCAN website, linked here

-   **Case Volume:** Defines the total number of cases incorporated into the metric measurement for a given quarter. This also serves as the denominator for the metric. If the cell is blank but additional data is recorded in the same row, the number is hidden due to small number suppression rules.

-   **Current Quarter Moving Average:** Defines the outcomes of the specific metric and trust chosen with respect to the case volume during the quarter.

-   **Comparison to Previous Quarter Moving Average:** This percentage (%) represents the relative change in performance in comparison to the previous reported quarter. This result is presented in a gradient- the darker green, the better the metric performance in comparison to the previous quarter. In contrast, the darker red correlates to a worse performance in comparison to the previous quarter. If needed, a vision deficient-friendly scale is also provided.

-   **Comparison to Cancer Alliance Average:** This percentage (%) represents the relative change in performance in comparison to the cancer alliance the trust belongs to. Cancer alliance details can be found here. The gradient here follows the same rules as provided above in the “Comparison to previous quarter” description.

-   **Comparison to National Performance Average:** This percentage (%) represents the relative change in performance in comparison to the performance of all trusts reporting on the metric for that given quarter and year. The gradient here follows the same rules as provided above in the “Comparison to previous quarter” description.
