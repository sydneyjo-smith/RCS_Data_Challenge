# Dashboard Overview

## History and Summary of Dashboard Data:

This dashboard is intended to provide high-level insight into the performance of cancer services within NHS facilities throughout England and Wales. This data is collected as a partnership between the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/), [Royal College of Surgeons](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/), and the [National Cancer Audit Collaborating Center (NATCAN)](https://www.natcan.org.uk/).

The dataset is linked to Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) and Patient Episode Database for Wales (PEDW) at patient level to obtain further information on patient care and follow-up such as emergency readmission. Linkage to Office for National Statistics records provides information about date and cause of death.

Trust outcomes are reported by the trust/hospital/MDT on a quarterly basis, with quarters defined as:

-   Quarter 1- January 1st through March 31st

-   Quarter 2- April 1st through June 30th

-   Quarter 3- July 1st through September 30th

-   Quarter 4- October 1st through December 31st

Both Performance Metrics (measuring key treatment metrics) and data quality (measuring the completeness of the data reported by the service provider) are recorded. For more detail around these metrics, please visit the [NATCAN website](https://www.nboca.org.uk/trust-results/explanatory-notes/2021-2022/).
